	abstract = {Particulate Matter ({PM}) low-cost sensors ({LCS}) present a cost-effective opportunity to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of airborne {PM} data. Previous studies focused on {PM}-{LCS}-reported hourly data and identified, without fully addressing, their limitations. However, {PM}-{LCS} pro­ vide measurements at finer temporal resolutions. Furthermore, government bodies have devel­ oped certifications to accompany new uses of these sensors, but these certifications have shortcomings. To address these knowledge gaps, {PM}-{LCS} of two models, 8 Sensirion {SPS}30 and 8 Plantower {PMS}5003, were collocated for one year with a Fidas 200S, {MCERTS}-certified {PM} monitor and were characterised at 2 min resolution, enabling replication of certification pro­ cesses, and highlighting their limitations and improvements. Robust linear models using sensorreported particle number concentrations and relative humidity, coupled with 2-week biannual calibration campaigns, achieved reference-grade performance, at median {PM}2.5 background concentration of 5.5 μg/m3, demonstrating that, with careful calibration, {PM}-{LCS} may costeffectively supplement reference equipment in multi-nodes networks with fine spatiotemporality.},
