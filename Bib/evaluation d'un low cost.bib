	abstract = {Low-cost sensors are an opportunity to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of particulate matter data. However, such sensors should be calibrated under conditions close to the final ones before any monitoring actions. The paper presents the results of a collocated comparison of four models of low-cost optical sensors with a {TEOM} 1400a analyser. {SDS}011 (Nova Fitness), {ZH}03A (Winsen), {PMS}7003 (Plantower), and {OPC}-N2 (Alphasense) sensors were used in this research. Three copies of each sensor model were placed in a common box to compare the sensor performance under the same measurement conditions. Monitoring of the {PM}

              fraction was conducted for almost half a year from 21 August 2017 to 19 February 2018 in Wrocław (Poland). Reproducibility between sensor units was assessed on the basis of coefficient of variation ({CV}). {CV} values were lower than 7\% in the case of {SDS}011 and {PMS}7003 sensors and equal to 20\% for {OPC}-N2 units. {CV} was higher than 50\% for {ZH}03A, mainly due to malfunctions. During the measurements, the trends of outputs from sensors were generally similar to {TEOM} data, but significant overestimation of {PM}

              concentrations was observed for the sensor raw data. A high linear relationship between {TEOM} and sensors was noticed for 1 min, 15 min, and 1-hour averaged data for {PMS}7003 sensors (
