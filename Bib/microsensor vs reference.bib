	abstract = {The 1st {EuNetAir} Air Quality Joint Intercomparison Exercise organized in Aveiro (Portugal) from 13th e27th October 2014, focused on the evaluation and assessment of environmental gas, particulate matter ({PM}) and meteorological microsensors, versus standard air quality reference methods through an experimental urban air quality monitoring campaign. The {IDAD}-Institute of Environment and Development Air Quality Mobile Laboratory was placed at an urban trafﬁc location in the city centre of Aveiro to conduct continuous measurements with standard equipment and reference analysers for {CO}, {NOx}, O3, {SO}2, {PM}10, {PM}2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and precipitation.},
