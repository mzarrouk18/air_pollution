	abstract = {A growing number of companies have started commercializing low-cost sensors ({LCS}) that are said to be able to monitor air pollution in outdoor air. The beneﬁt of the use of {LCS} is the increased spatial coverage when monitoring air quality in cities and remote locations. Today, there are hundreds of {LCS} commercially available on the market with costs ranging from several hundred to several thousand euro. At the same time, the scientiﬁc literature currently reports independent evaluation of the performance of {LCS} against reference measurements for about 110 {LCS}. These studies report that {LCS} are unstable and often aﬀected by atmospheric conditions—cross-sensitivities from interfering compounds that may change {LCS} performance depending on site location. In this work, quantitative data regarding the performance of {LCS} against reference measurement are presented. This information was gathered from published reports and relevant testing laboratories. Other information was drawn from peer-reviewed journals that tested diﬀerent types of {LCS} in research studies. Relevant metrics about the comparison of {LCS} systems against reference systems highlighted the most cost-eﬀective {LCS} that could be used to monitor air quality pollutants with a good level of agreement represented by a coeﬃcient of determination R2 {\textgreater} 0.75 and slope close to 1.0. This review highlights the possibility to have versatile {LCS} able to operate with multiple pollutants and preferably with transparent {LCS} data treatment.},
