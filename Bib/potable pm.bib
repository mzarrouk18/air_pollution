	abstract = {In this study, we calibrated the performance of low-cost and portable {PM} sensors under the condition of steady-state particle mass concentration by challenging them with lab-generated particles in diﬀerent size distributions and compositions. Tested {PM} sensors included four lowcost optical sensors, i.e., Sharp, Shinyei, Samyoung and Oneair, {TSI} {DustTrak} and Personal Dust Monitor ({PDM}). A scientiﬁc Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance ({TEOM}; Thermal Scientiﬁc Model 1405) was applied as the reference. Same as what concluded in previous studies, our calibration data show that the readouts of all tested {PM} sensors had linear relationships with the particle mass concentration when the size distribution and composition of test particles were kept unchanged. However, the linear calibration lines for four low-cost {PM} sensors and {DustTrak} are diﬀerent when the size distribution (i.e., mean size and geometrical standard deviation) and composition of particles were varied. The {PDM} output in general agreed well with that of reference {TEOM} for particles with mass concentration higher than 300 μg/m3. The {PDM}, however, lost its sensitivity for measuring particles in the mass concentration less than 300 μg/m3. Our study also demonstrated that the calibration of low-cost {PM} sensors should be performed under the condition of steady particle mass concentration instead of under the condition of transient particle concentration, even at very slow transient situation.},
