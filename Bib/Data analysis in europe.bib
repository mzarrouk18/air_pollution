	abstract = {Public access to information about the environment is being strengthened across Europe. The concept of public’s right to information gives the basis for the access to environmental information. In this paper the quality of air pollutant monitoring systems in the 15 European member states is analyzed. For pragmatic reasons only the capitals are looked upon. Comprehensive data on environmental monitoring programs concerning air pollutants like ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2), nitrogen oxide ({NO}), carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and carbon monoxide ({CO}), and sometimes suspended dust, benzene and other environmental chemicals are available on the free Internet. As different monitoring information systems exist in the European member states a comparison of these systems with their pros and cons is of great interest to the public. Environmental air pollutant monitoring systems in the capitals of the 15 {EEC} member countries (objects) are evaluated by applying 5 evaluation criteria for the differentiation of these systems. The scores run from 0 ¼ insufﬁcient, 1 ¼ medium, to 2 ¼ excellent.},
