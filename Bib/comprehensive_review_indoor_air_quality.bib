	abstract = {Indoor air pollution ({IAP}) is a relevant area of concern for most developing countries as it has a direct impact on mortality and morbidity. Around 3 billion people throughout the world use coal and biomass (crop residues, wood, dung, and charcoal) as the primary source of domestic energy. Moreover, humans spend 80–90\% of their routine time indoors, so indoor air quality ({IAQ}) leaves a direct impact on overall health and work efficiency. In this paper, the authors described the relationship between {IAP} exposure and associated risks. The main idea is to discuss the use of wireless technologies for the development of cyber-physical systems for real-time monitoring. Furthermore, it provides a critical review of microcontrollers used for system designing and challenges in the development of real-time monitoring systems. This paper also presents some new ideas and scopes in the field of {IAQ} monitoring for the researchers.},
