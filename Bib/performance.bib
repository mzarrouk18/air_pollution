	abstract = {The monitoring of air quality compliance requires the use of Federal Reference Methods ({FRM})/Federal Equivalent Methods ({FEM}); nevertheless, the validity and reliability of low-cost sensors deserve attention due to their affordability and accessibility. This review examines the methodologies of previous studies to characterise the performance of low-cost air quality sensors and to identify the inﬂuential factors in sensor evaluation experiments. The data on four statistical measures (Correlation of Determination, r2; Root Mean Square Error, {RMSE}; Mean Normalised Bias, {MNB}; and Coefﬁcient of Variation, {CV}) and details about ﬁve methodological factors in experimental design (environmental setting, reference instrument, regression model, pollutant attribute, and sensor original equipment manufacturer ({OEM}) speciﬁcation) were extracted from a total of 112 primary articles for a detailed analysis. The results of the analysis suggested that low-cost air quality sensors exhibited improved r2 and {RMSE} in the experiments with stable environmental settings, in the comparison against non-designated reference instruments, or in the analysis where advanced regression models were used to adjust the sensor readings. However, the pollutant attribute and sensor {OEM} speciﬁcation had inconclusive effects on r2 and {RMSE} due to contradictory results and lack of sufﬁcient data. {MNB} and {CV}, two measures that {US} {EPA} recommends to determine the suitable application tier of air quality sensors, varied signiﬁcantly among published experiments due to the discrepancy in experimental design. The outcomes of this work could provide direction to researchers regarding sensor evaluation experiments and guide practitioners to effectively select and deploy low-cost sensors for air quality monitoring.},
